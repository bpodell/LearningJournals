# LJ Code 401 - Day 13

This week we have been learning about building our own API

The basic framework is PUT/POST/DELETE/GET requests are sent to the server, a new route object is created with the appropriate information. That route object is then sent to storage, the appropriate action is taken in storage. The response is sent back from storage, and then the server will handle what response is ended up being sent to the user. 


We also learned about Promises, which are a much easier and cleaner way to utilize asynchronous functions. We used to have to write callbacks within callbacks to ensure our operations went in the right order, but with promises we can encapulate our asynch functions and the promises will implicitly wait for the asynch to finish before it returns. 


This week has been going ok so far, lets keep it going 3/10.
