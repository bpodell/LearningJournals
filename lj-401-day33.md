# LJ Code 401 - Day 28

This week we have been learning Redux. Redux is helpful because it creates essentially a global state object, so we can access it in any component without having to keep passing it through props. We can also do the same thing with props, we can mount props to any specific component instead of having to pass it through the heirarchy. 

The tricky things about this is learning how to utitlize the actions and the reducers. Actions package up a payload, essentially mocking up the object we want to send to state, and then reducers take action on the state with that given action and payload. 

This week has been tough but I think the rest of the week will go smoothly after this catch up day.
