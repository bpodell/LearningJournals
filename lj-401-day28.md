# LJ Code 401 - Day 28

This is our first week of front end. It surprised me because I thought it would be a lot more about the art of formatting but right now its still trying to get some info to show up on the page.

We are working with React, which is a cool system for compiling your data onto the screen. It utilizes a 'state' property, and when the state of the app changes it re-renders the page. It's a little like how we used Handlebars in 301 but its a much more dynamic system. 

I thought I was going to hate the front end stuff but so far this week has been pretty fun. I look forward to seeing what we do next.
