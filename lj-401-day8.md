# LJ Code 401 - Day 8

This week has been hard, but I suppose they all will be from here on out.

We've been learning about linked lists which I think I have a pretty good handle on. Its a data structure that are interconnected nodes, and while the nodes aren't physcially connected like in an array, the nodes have directional pointers for where to find the next node in the sequence.

We've also learned a lot about servers. We've been building our own servers and it gets pretty tricky having to follow your code through like 8 different modules. Hopefully I'll get a better understanding during code review tomorrow. I actually had a one-off bug in my code today that no one I should it to could figure out, even if our codes looked exactly the same. That was very frustrating to deal with but hopefully my teacher can sort it out tomorrow.

Other than that I'm working extremely hard and this class is very challenging. Here's hoping tomorrow is better.
