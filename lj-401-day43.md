# LJ Code 401 - Day 43

This week we have been reviewing multiple different topics. Starting on Monday we reviewed Oauth, specifically with Google. THis is the process of using Google as an intermediate in the sign in process to your site, for added protection. It takes your google acct name and password and checks it against their database, it then checks to make sure its your back end that is trying to use it. Upon completion of that you are given an access token to the users google+ profile, which you can then use to verify/create that users profile in your own system.

Tuesday we learned different sorting algorithms. Merge sort is when you divide the array in half until you get down to pairs of two numbers in each array. You then sort that pair, then merge it with the pair next to it, sorting in order. You then continue this pattern until the entire number has been rebuilt. Quick sort is the other method. This involves creating a pivot number, and a current highest value. You iterate through the number until a lower number appears in the array, it is swapped with the highest number, and then the new high is moved one across to the next integer. 

Wednesday has been learning about how to stress test an api using Artillery.
