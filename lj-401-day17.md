# LJ Code 401 - Day 17

This week we have been continuing our work on our Restful api's, we've now included mongo db to make our system a little more professional, as opposed to using local storage or a filesystem to store our data. Getting used to mongo the first couple days was a little hectic but like anything else all it takes is practice to get used to it. 

We also learned about k-ary trees, which are similar to binary trees except they can branch in multiple directions whereas binary trees are balanced. Working with the trees is a lot more fun than the api, but it makes sense why we have to practice it so much because it is a fundamental part of any web application. 

Week 4 almost in the books, time seems to be going by both quickly and at a snails pace... I guess it depends on what time of the day you ask me.
