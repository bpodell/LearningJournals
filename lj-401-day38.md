# LJ Code 401 - Day 38

This week we have been learning about React/Redux with a functioning backend. Last week we had no persistence layer so the only things in state were the things we put into it during each session. Now we have a full Mongo Database running in the background so every time we log into a new session our data from before has prepopulated. It is a nice touch because all we have been working towards these past 8 weeks are now coming together in one. 

We got assigned our groups for final projects today. I'm thinking about what I want to make and I'm thinking that a project involving Twitch.tv would be fun. Its a huge platform thats constantly growing and there is room for devs to make improvements to it. I think if I find a good idea with twitch it could be really fun and possibly actually useful.
