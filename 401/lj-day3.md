# Lj day3

This week has been extremely difficult. The labs are uncertain. The wording is confusing, how to set it up is confusing, what we are supposed to submit is uncertain. 
It feels like we are being thrown an obscene amount of code with minimal instruction. The demos in class hardly seem to be useful to what we are doing, at least to the detail that we are going. If i didn't have my peers here with me there is no way I would've been able to solve this stuff. This is the first day I've ever truly stayed late. I've been here for over 12 hours today.
Now its time to get the bus and go to sleep. Not before i do my readings tho XD.
