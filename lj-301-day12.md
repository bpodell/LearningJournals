Today was the first day we started on our book app. It was a very frustrating exprience because again we were thrown into the deep end with little instruction and were asked to figure it out as we went. Getting our data into the database took a long time because we had to manually enter it, and then had to switch users and do it all again because my partner couldnt deploy to heroku. 
#
Then we got our scaffolding for the html setup, which all we had to do was get it set up to take in handlebars inputs, and then we would append all our books onto that, just like with our articles. I believe our code for this looks good but we could never get our server to communicate with us, so we can't know for sure.
#
Then we got our functions running and again they look good in theory but since we cant test them we don't know for sure. This is probably going to be the most frustrating part of this week's lab because so much of this process relies on the MVC being able to communicate. I believe once we accomplish this we will be on a good level.
