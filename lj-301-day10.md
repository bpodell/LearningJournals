This is the end of week 2, its crazy that its going by so fast. Next week we are building the app and then its project week. We learned about some new array methods in class. Reduce, map, and filter. Reduce takes the sum by using acc and curr, it will take the accumulation and add the current index. Map creates an entirely new array and any actions we take on the index will populate in the new array. Filter takes out any unwanted values from an array.
