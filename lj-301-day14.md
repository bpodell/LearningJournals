# LJ Code 301 - Day 14

These past few days have been so crazy. Weve been building our book app from scratch and it just relies on so much code. Its hard to know where to begin because every piece seems to rely on another so by the time you get to debugging your code it feels like you don't even know where to start because you don't know if any of the parts work or are talking to each other.

As far as what we've learned I think its been a lot. We've learned a lot about how the MVC works, as we now have complete control over all aspects of it. The server needs to get the response, send the request, the client queries, sends its reply, back to the server and then the server sends it back for our functions to use. In theory it sounds like a simple process but when you have to code every part of it yourself its easy to get lost.

We also learned about pages(), which basically is an event listener for a user going to a different url, and then executing the functions we tell it when it hits that listener. We used this today by having our user click links that would send them to different urls, and then based on that url the pages() told our website which functions to run to display the appropriate information.
