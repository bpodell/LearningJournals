# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

Finished up with the lab and the entrace exam today. It's been a crazy last couple of weeks. I passed my final which is a big relief. Now its just project week coming up, we don't have any good ideas yet but I'm not too worried. We can always just do the Dota thing. 

After project week I'm going to AZ to be with my parents. It will be the longest I've spent with them since I moved out. It will be nice because I probably won't have a chance to be away from home for this long again since I will hopefully find a job once I graduate from 401. My life has been kinda crazy recently, but change is good. Bring it on project week.
