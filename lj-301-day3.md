Today was actually a very frustrating lab. Its difficult because they give you a whole lot of code to work on, which makes it difficult to troubleshoot whats going wrong because you're changing so much at once. As opposed to 201 when you were literally building everything from scratch so if something went wrong you knew where you could look for an issue.
I suppose a way to remedy this in our current lab would be to troubleshoot our solutions after each line of code.
Working with partners is difficult as well because they will do things that you do not tell them and sometimes wont listen to what you're saying even when you give them exact directions. Another thing was I was supposed to be the driver at a certain point today and the other person just started working on his device, leaving me with minor changes on mine which I couldnt then merge which was stressful. 
I'm getting more used to working in this environment but its still stressful when you've been working for a few hours and nothing you've done has seemed to make any progress.
